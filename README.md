# Wine_Quality_Predection__ml
## Overview
The Wine Quality Prediction project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties.

This project aims to demonstrate the application of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation techniques in a real-world dataset.

The project leverages popular machine learning algorithms and evaluates their performance to identify the best model for predicting wine quality.


Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the " Wine Quality dataset" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains chemical properties of red and white wines, along with their quality ratings.


Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.


Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the relationships between features and the target variable.


Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.


Model Evaluation: Comparison of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.


Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model parameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.


Prediction: Making predictions on unseen data and evaluating the performance of the final model.


Installation
